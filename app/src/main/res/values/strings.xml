    <string name="detail_text">Reading is vital to a child’s ability to learn and be successful in school. Your child’s ability to read develops from birth, but it doesn’t happen automatically. Children’s brains are not pre-wired for reading. When they hear and use language, their brains develop the important connections needed to learn how to read.Tell stories and encourage conversation; make it interactive and fun. Parents need to support a strong development of home language skills so that students enter school prepared with the core knowledge and vocabulary in their home language that will help them to thrive.</string>
